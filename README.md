# Larson-Lab-Helpful-Code
This repository contains helpful code for data analyses in Dr. Michael Larson's lab at Brigham Young University. These scripts mainly focus on EEG data. The repository is maintained by Alex Muir (alexandrammuir@gmail.com) and as such, will contain the most recent versions of the code. As always, feel free to reach out with questions!
